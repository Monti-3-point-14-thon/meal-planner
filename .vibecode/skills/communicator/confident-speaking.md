## Core Frameworks

### Framework: WHAT → SO WHAT → NOW WHAT
**Source:** Matt Abrahams (Stanford GSB)
**When to use:** Any verbal communication
**How to apply:**

**Structure:**
- **WHAT:** The information/idea
- **SO WHAT:** Why it matters
- **NOW WHAT:** What to do next

**Examples:**

**Technical Update:**
```
WHAT: "We migrated to PostgreSQL this week"
SO WHAT: "This enables full-text search and reduces query time by 60%"
NOW WHAT: "We can now build the advanced search feature users requested"
```

**User Feedback:**
```
WHAT: "10 users requested dark mode"
SO WHAT: "It's the #1 feature request, blocking 3 enterprise deals"
NOW WHAT: "I propose we prioritize it for next sprint"
```

**Product Demo:**
```
WHAT: "This is the AI code review feature"
SO WHAT: "It catches bugs 10x faster than manual review"
NOW WHAT: "Try it on your codebase - link in chat"
```

3. Solution (2 minutes)
   [Your product/feature]
   - WHAT it is
   - SO WHAT (why it matters)
   - NOW WHAT (how to use it)

4. Evidence (1 minute)
   [Proof it works - data, testimonial]
