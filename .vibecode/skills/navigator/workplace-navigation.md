## Core Framework: Conflict Resolution
**Source:** Anneka Gupta
**When to use:** Dealing with difficult colleagues or conflicts

**The Approach:**
1. **Understand root cause** - Fear, misalignment, ego, or style?
2. **Find shared goals** - What do we both want?
3. **Address directly** - Use clear, non-confrontational communication
4. **Escalate if needed** - Document and involve management

**Common Causes:**
- **Fear:** Job security, insecurity
- **Misalignment:** Different goals or priorities
- **Ego:** Need to be right or in control
- **Style:** Communication differences
